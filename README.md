<h1>Project description</h1>

As a Data Scientist role, a start-up that provides streaming platform aggregation services requested the creation of a recommendation system for its database. This consisted of being able to give the user the possibility of accessing five consultations. To do this, we proceeded to carry out its corresponding ETL, EDA and a ML recommendation system.


<h1>Project Status</h1>

<h4 align="center">
:construction: Proyecto en construcci√≥n :construction:
</h4>

The status of this project is in its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version. The ETL applied here is the standard for an adequate treatment of information. The EDA is moderate for delivery times. Finally, the ML system is the one requested, although in its most basic version.

<h1>Application and Demo Features</h1>

 :hammer: Project Inquiries

- `Query 1`: Returns the number of films that were released in the month consulted in the entire dataset.
- `Query 2`: Returns the number of films that were released on the day consulted in the entire dataset.
- `Query 3`: The title of a film is entered, waiting for the title, the year of release and the score as a response.
- `Query 4`: The title of a film is entered, waiting for the title, the number of votes and the average value of the votes as a response. The same variable must have at least 2000 evaluations, otherwise, we must have a message warning that this condition is not met and therefore no value is returned.
- `Query 5`: The name of an actor that is inside a dataset is entered, and the success of the same measured through the return must be returned. In addition, the number of films in which he has participated and the average return.
- `Query 6`: The name of a director found within a dataset is entered, and the success of the same measured through the return must be returned. In addition, you must return the name of each film with the release date, individual return, cost and profit of the same.
- `Query ML`: The name of a movie is entered and it recommends similar ones in a list of 5 values.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

After completing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and ML (Machine Learning) project, several important conclusions can be reached.

First, the ETL process is crucial to ensure that the data is clean, structured, and ready for cross-platform analysis. The transformation phase is particularly important, as this is where data manipulation and cleansing techniques can be applied to prepare the data for further analysis in the various requested queries.

Second, the EDA phase can provide valuable insights into the data and help identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between id, title, year, scored, and platform . This stage can be especially important to understand the data set and to help decide what kind of ML algorithms might be best suited for analysis.

Finally, the ML phase is where machine learning algorithms are applied to obtain actionable insights from the data, and thus create the recommendation system.

In conclusion, the ETL, EDA, and ML process is a fundamental part of modern data analysis. Each stage is important and provides valuable information that can help you make informed, data-driven decisions.
